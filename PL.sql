-- RESET PL and 3 CUD procedures for M:N relationship BirderRewards
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------

-- Ayush Baruah & Joseph Eidel

-- Citation for the following code:
-- Date: 08/04/26 edited 08/10/26
-- Copied from /OR/ Adapted from /OR/ Based on 
-- Procedures were written with the help of AI
-- Source URL: claude.ai
-- If AI tools were used: CLaude was used with the following prompt having context of the DDL.sql file
-- Prompt: "Using the ddl.sql file, write a PL procedure called reset_avidex that will reset our database to this state."
-- Prompt: "Using the ddl.sql file, write 3 PL procedures for our M:N table called BirdersRewards. One for each of the CUD operations."
-- Drops and recreates every Avidex table, then reloads the sample data.
-- Create, Update, Delete procedures for the M:N table BirderRewards between Birders and Rewards
-- Source URL: CoPilot
-- Prompt: "can you add comments like the one above pl_add_birder_reward for each pl? 
--          and can you make it so that each intersection CREATE has the same checks as the pl_add_birder_reward procedure?
-- Usage:  CALL reset_avidex();
